### Question 2

```
For this challenge I build the modal using Vue as recommended. This was a breath of a fresh air as I mainly use React.js for my front-end work. From this challenge I really appreciate how much less boilerplate was involved in getting started. I only needed to install one third party package whereas in react I need to install router and redux to get the features vue has out of the box. React does has its advantages over vue too. There's a huge ecosystem of tools packages and support vs Vue. Typescript support is much better using react. 

While working on this I got distracted and started looking into vuex. From playing around with it Vuex requires a lot less ugly boilerplate code than Redux and also makes it a lot easier to update deeply-nested properties. In theory I could have setup a vuex in this project by tracking the state of the users bag by adding and removing items. I’m very curious to see how this could scale with a larger application especially with the ability to use two way binding.

To quickly get started I used vuetify as my css framework. Its clean and for a single page app I like material design. However the documentation wasn't great and I spend some time trying to tweak small details of the built in components and had to dig in veutifys issue page on github more than once.   Normally for larger projects i would want a more customizable framework like style-components or bootstrap. 

I think I made a good choice for the scope of the project. Had I’d been starting a larger application I’d would have chosen a more custom css framework that is well supported in Vue. Having a well managed style system can really speed up development.
