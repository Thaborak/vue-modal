### Post Mortem

```
For this challenge I build the modal using Vue as recommended. 

To quickly get started I used vuetify as my css framework. Its clean and for a single page app I like material design. However the documentation wasn't great and I spend some time trying to tweak small details of the built in components and had to dig in veutifys issue page on github more than once.   Normally for larger projects i would want a more customizable framework like style-components or bootstrap. 

I think I made a good choice for the scope of the project. Had I’d been starting a larger application I’d would have chosen a more custom css framework that is well supported in Vue. Having a well managed style system can really speed up development.
